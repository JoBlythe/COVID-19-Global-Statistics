Data Analyst Portfolio Project - Data Cleaning and Visualization
Welcome to my GitHub repository for my first Data Analyst portfolio project! In this project, I showcase my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using a combination of SQL (specifically BigQuery SQL workspace), Excel, and Tableau.

Project Overview
In this project, I focused on mastering the fundamental aspects of data analysis, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. I used a variety of tools and techniques to ensure the data was accurate, reliable, and ready for analysis.

Skills Demonstrated
Data Cleaning: I employed SQL, specifically BigQuery SQL workspace, to clean and preprocess the raw data. This involved tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and structuring the data for analysis.

Excel: As part of the data cleaning process, I utilized Excel to further refine the data. This included tasks such as formatting, formula application, and data validation.

Tableau Data Visualization: After preparing the clean dataset, I used Tableau to create meaningful and insightful visualizations. These visualizations help convey patterns, trends, and insights that may not be immediately apparent in the raw data.
